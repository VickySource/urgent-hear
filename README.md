# 🚨 SurakshaAI – Multilingual Voice Intelligence for 1092 Helpline

SurakshaAI is an AI-powered voice intelligence system designed to improve the effectiveness of the 1092 helpline by ensuring **accurate understanding before response**.

It enables real-time multilingual voice interaction, sentiment-aware analysis, and a verification-first approach to reduce miscommunication in emergency situations.

---

## 🎯 Problem

Emergency helplines often face:

- 🌐 Multilingual communication (Kannada, Hindi, English)
- 🗣️ Dialect and informal speech variations
- 😰 Emotionally charged conversations (panic, fear, urgency)
- ❌ Misunderstanding leading to incorrect responses

---

## 💡 Solution

SurakshaAI introduces an **AI-assisted voice-to-voice system** that:

- Understands user input in multiple languages
- Detects sentiment and urgency
- Verifies understanding before taking action
- Escalates to human agents when needed

---

## 🔥 Core Feature: Verification Loop

Unlike traditional systems, SurakshaAI ensures:

> ❗ "No action is taken without confirmed understanding"

### Flow:

1. AI interprets user input
2. System restates the issue
3. User confirms:
   - ✅ Correct
   - ⚠️ Partially Correct
   - ❌ Incorrect
